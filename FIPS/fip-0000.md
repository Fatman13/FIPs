## Simple Summary

Recalibrate Filecoin's protocol architecture vision to guide future FIPs to the betterment of the whole network.

## Abstract

As Filecoin goes close into its third year since mainnet launch, more and more challenges have presented themselves and network as a whole struggled to reach soft consensus to push for FIPs that could potentially address the many of the network issues. The network now desperately needs set of clear principles on where Filecoin protocol will go in the long-run and a clear path to achieve such vision (a master plan for protocol architecture and design). Therefore, the following principles are proposed...

- Simplification of Filecoin L1: to make L1 protocol lean and more attractive to a broader pool of potential participants to join.
- Drive for user-defined (L2) storage marketplace: incubate sustainable environment for valuable data on-boarding and facilitate paid deals

It is acknowledged that the exact path to realize such is varied depend on different experience and background each network contributor has. This proposal tries to paint one path to that end and much of the details are all open for discussions.

## Change Motivation

Just like the network as a whole needs a [master plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrqavbeDDY0) to steer its development and priorities, the evolution of Filecoin protocol itself also needs a master plan to adapt itself in the ever changing market environment. Right now, FIPing is like guerrilla warfare with no clear strategic goal in mind. In a way, battles are won but the war is lost. Only with a Filecoin protocol master plan **thoroughly** and **openly** discussed, then we could move on to take the network to the next level/stage.

##  Specification

Again all details in this version of Filecoin protocol master plan design is open for discussion. No particular parameter is set in stone. (Ideas [borrowed](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/1nz9MjMBxvsydLZy3LiUYA) from @steven004)

- **Level all sector power**: CC sectors and DC sectors will all just have raw byte storage power, effectively removing concept of QAP and reducing L1 complexity.
- **Add `subsidy` built-in actor**: with sectors normalized, the subsidized reward for storage deals is completely decoupled from storage power and will be managed by `subsidy` built-in actor. (revisit of [FIP0033](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0033.md))
- **Move market actor to L2**: introduce a concept of verified market actor on L2 which can enjoy its share of the reward from `subsidy` actor if network participants made storage deals through this actor. 
- **Dynamic reward sharing**: block reward will be shared between `subsidy` and `miner` actor, each claiming 50% of the BR with `subsidy` gradually decay to 10% of the BR. (revisit of [FIP442](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/442))
- **Cap slashing for consensus miner**: ongoing [FIP712](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/712) discussion.

## Design Rationale

One of the key characteristics of this design is the layered approach through decoupling a complex interlinked system into two distinct functional space.

Leveling all sector power is the corner stone of the whole design. All sectors are born equally through PoRep and should be treated equally. QAP not only adds unnecessary complexity to L1 as the network is slowly but surely becoming a DC only network (with growing [security concerns](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/554#discussioncomment-4605247)), but also couples rewards with storage power which limits many potential innovations on a truly value driven storage deal marketplace. Besides, with QAP gone and subsidy for storage deals untied from storage power, the protocol could actually leverage L2 to have much more flexible ways to subsidize storage deals. 

To achieve the eventual paid storage deals for network participants and to accommodate [f+ program](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/636#discussioncomment-5076101), a 50-50 BR split between the `subsidy` and `miner` actor is proposed. This roughly allows every network participants to maintain its current block revenue, as at the writing of this proposal QAP of DC and QAP of CC are [relatively close](https://filscan.io/). To help  network participants to transition from subsidized deals to actual paid deals, the share of `subsidy` BR will be ever shrinking according to a f(x) and reach a 10-90 BR split with `miner` actor in the end.

Once the market actor is [pushed to L2](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/554#discussioncomment-4376052), it can then experiment with various deal terms to suit whatever client and provider want without the need to wait for a FIP discussion or a network upgrade. A governance body can determine which market actor to become a verified one to gain access to the deal subsidies from the `subsidy` actor. 

With user-defined layer and protocol layer properly separated, the core L1 consensus could just focus on what it does the best, namely EC based on storage capacity, a Turing complete vm and lastly storage proofs including PoRep and PoSt with sector as its fungible unit.

With unnormalized sector pledge where for 1 TiB of sectors you may have pledge ranging from 4 fil to 10 fil and slashing derived from BR when the sector is sealed which means that some sector may still have pledge left after slashing while some may go into debt after slashing, this complicates storage apps building on top of this complex slashing system, stalling innovations on user-defined [financing](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/691#discussioncomment-5817293) and storage markets. 

Additional design rationals... [1](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/725#discussioncomment-6191921)

## Incentive Considerations

The way protocol design is setup right now wipes out the potential for user-defined storage market because the incentive for QAP is too strong for it to compete. Given the new design, network incentive for early data on-boarding adopters could gradually be phased out and be substituted with proper market driven storage exchange. 

As reward for consensus mining become more predictable, a bigger pool of swing miners would likely to join and contribute to the security of the network. They can have better assessment of their share of the BR, their liquidity status to hedge against macro economy uncertainty, and potentially start storage providing if incentives are [aligned](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/712#discussioncomment-6108272).

## Product consideration

With the above design, it also comes with explicit [separation of roles](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/636#discussioncomment-5096322), namely consensus miner and storage provider, so that they could co-exist and each serves its purpose in the network.
